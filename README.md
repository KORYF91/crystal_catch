# crystal_catch
This game is simple and straight forwarder.
the user starts the game with the start button.
then the user will be given a random value to match.
the user is to match the value given by clicking on the crystals, of which there are four.
each crystal has its own value and if the user can match his total to the value generated from the start button they win. 
if they over shoot the value they loose. 
then you can re-start and go all over again with a new set of numbers.
